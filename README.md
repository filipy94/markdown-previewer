# React-Markdown-Previewer :symbols:

This project is part of the FreeCodeCamp's Front End Certification.
It was built using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Marked](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/marked) library.

## Functionality :white_check_mark:

-  When I enter **GitHub** flavored markdown into the #editor element, the text is rendered as HTML in the #preview element as I type (HINT: You don't need to parse Markdown yourself - you can import the Marked library for this: [Marked](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/marked).
- When my markdown previewer first loads, the default text in the #editor field should contain valid markdown that represents at least one of each of the following elements: a header (H1 size), a sub header (H2 size), a link, inline code, a code block, a list item, a blockquote, an image, and bolded text.
- When my markdown previewer first loads, the default markdown in the #editor field should be rendered as HTML in the #preview element.
